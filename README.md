Maelstrom
=========

A distributed, fault-tolerant, and soft real-time computation platform. Instead of parallel computing in batches (Map/Reduce) Maelstrom handles its units of computation in streams, in parallel, and distributed in a cluster.

Maelstrom is master-less and therefore has no single point of failure.

And yes, it is in development. I want a replacement for Storm but built in Erlang.
