# Hi!

Is a distributed, fault-tolerant, and soft real-time computation platform. As opposed to Map/Reduce, Maelstrom handles
its units of computation in streams, in parallel across a cluster, and concurrently on each node.

The goal is to provide a generalized framework for parallel, concurrent, and distributed computational work-loads that
are non-trivial.

## Design

Tekmo's excellent Pipes library and 3rd-party additions on-top of Pipes provide a solid foundation for building
Maelstrom. This readme will temporarily serve as a holding place for my ideas, resources, and thoughts as I work on this
project.
